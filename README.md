This Demo gives u a brief overview on how Unity works. It consists of the typical "HelloWorld" Unity project u might wanna start with, when you are new to game dev and Unity.
The Game consists of a few scripts which gets you started with a simple playable charachter which has the ability to collect coins. There is also a very simple ui which gets updated when collecting coins.
